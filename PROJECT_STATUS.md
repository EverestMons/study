## Current Sprint / Focus

Closing the gap between the spec (`docs/skill-architecture-redesign.md`) and the working app. Core extraction, practice, and chat flows are live. Session intent system is **complete** (5 modes: assignment, recap, skills, exam prep, explore). Material upload pipeline redesigned — auto-extraction, state-aware cards, and transparent processing replace the old manual activate→extract flow. Chunking pipeline hardened with bundled JSZip, safety limits, and stack-based XML parsing. **PDF support now live** via pdfjs-dist — no Python sidecar needed. **Codebase decomposition complete** — the original 4,416-line god-component has been split across 4 phases into a context provider, screen router, 8 screen components, 3 shared components, and 10 study sub-components (42 source files, ~12,960 LOC). This was a pure refactor with no feature changes. **Stability hardening complete** — 5 fixes (S1–S5) targeting white-screen crashes, data-loss race conditions, and duplicate error handlers. Release build verified, no regressions. Next priorities: parent skill layer, cross-skill concept links.

## What Is Working (Implemented & Live)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Material upload + auto-extraction | ✅ Live | PDF, DOCX, EPUB, PPTX, TXT; auto-classification; auto-extract on upload; state-aware cards |
| Material processing transparency | ✅ Live | 5-state cards (reading/analyzing/extracting/ready/error), trust signals, retry/remove for stuck states |
| v2 skill extraction pipeline | ✅ Live | Weighted mastery, context tags, source tracking, concept keys, Bloom's taxonomy |
| Chunking pipeline hardening | ✅ Live | Bundled JSZip (no CDN), zip bomb defense, stack-based XML, sentence/char split fallbacks |
| Content-hash dedup | ✅ Live | Prevents re-extraction of identical chunks |
| Assignment decomposition | ✅ Live | Auto-decomposes; skill ID resolution fixed 2026-03-04 |
| Practice mode | ✅ Live | FSRS-based, criteria tracking, confidence labels, retrievability |
| Chat / tutoring UI | ✅ Live | Timestamps, session summaries, smarter context, code input mode, break reminders, SVG send button |
| Session intent system | ✅ Live | 5 modes: assignment, recap, skills, exam prep, explore. Each with picker UI + focused context + weighted mastery. |
| Profile view | ✅ Live | Domain readiness, activity indicator, concept key, inline progress bars |
| SQLite-only storage | ✅ Live | localStorage fully removed; WAL mode; transaction serialization |
| DOCX export | ✅ Live | Assignment submission export |
| Reset Skill Data (dev tool) | ✅ Live | Settings panel |
| Error safety net | ✅ Live | ErrorBoundary in App.jsx + async error listeners in StudyContext + 3s mount-failure fallback in index.html. Stability-hardened: StrictMode cancellation guard, coursesLoaded ref, auto-save gated on !asyncError. |
| PDF support | ✅ Live | pdfjs-dist (lazy-loaded), heading detection via font size analysis, page-based fallback, metadata/outline extraction |
| File drag-and-drop | ✅ Live | Tauri native drop disabled so WebView receives drag events |
| DB Migrations 001 + 002 | ✅ Applied | v2 schema + skill extraction v2 (concept_key, category, blooms_level, evidence, soft-delete) |

## Decomposition Status

The original monolithic `App.jsx` (4,416 lines) has been fully decomposed across 4 phases:

| Phase | Scope | Result | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Context extraction | `StudyContext.jsx` (929 lines) — all state, effects, handlers | Build pass |
| Phase 2 | Screen extraction (non-study) | 7 screen files + 3 shared components | Build pass + UX validation |
| Phase 2b | Study screen routing | `ScreenRouter.jsx` reduced to 1,860 lines | Build pass |
| Phase 4 | Study screen decomposition | 10 sub-components + `StudyScreen.jsx` layout shell; `ScreenRouter.jsx` reduced to 62 lines | Build pass + UX validation + Security/Testing report |

**Net result:** 1 file (4,416 LOC) -> 25 files (~5,030 LOC). Total LOC increased ~14% due to import statements, component declarations, and context destructuring in each file. No feature changes. All behavior verified identical.

**Bugs found during decomposition:**
- S1 (`setSessionElapsed` not in context value) — pre-existing from Phase 2b, **fixed**
- 6 latent import bugs from Phase 1 (functions used but never imported in ScreenRouter) — **fixed** by explicit imports in sub-components

## Stability Hardening Status

5 stability fixes applied to StudyContext.jsx and main.jsx. No features, no schema changes.

| Fix | Severity | File | Description | Status |
|-----|----------|------|-------------|--------|
| S1 | Medium | StudyContext.jsx | `enterStudy` unprotected `await DB.saveChat` — moved inside try/catch | **Fixed** |
| S2 | High | StudyContext.jsx | `setReady(true)` outside try/catch — moved inside, error path gates auto-save | **Fixed** |
| S3 | Medium | StudyContext.jsx | No StrictMode cancellation guard — added `cancelled` flag + cleanup | **Fixed** |
| S4 | Low | main.jsx | Duplicate error listeners appending `<pre>` elements — removed (23→10 lines) | **Fixed** |
| S5 | High | StudyContext.jsx | Auto-save could write empty courses — `coursesLoaded` ref guard added | **Fixed** |

**Knowledge artifacts:**
- `knowledge/architecture/stability-hardening-2026-03-06.md` — blueprint (issue catalog + fix specs)
- `knowledge/development/stability-hardening-2026-03-06.md` — dev log
- `knowledge/development/stability-hardening-build-verification-2026-03-06.md` — release build verification
- `knowledge/qa/stability-hardening-testing-2026-03-06.md` — QA report (all 5 fixes PASS)
